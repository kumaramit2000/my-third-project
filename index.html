      <h2> SEE THIS </h2>
      <p>One web design trend that refuses to go away is parallax scrolling. With this, the website layout sees the background of the web page moving at a slower rate to the foreground, creating a 3D effect as you scroll. It can sometimes be overwhelming, but when used sparingly it can provide a nice, subtle element of depth that results in a distinctive and memorable website.
But to show how it should be done, we've collected together sites that employ the technique to good effect.
Subtle parallax is used throughout, but the real scene-stealer is the homepage. Grylls appears in a dramatic mountainscape, and the viewer is drawn into the scene as they scroll. It’s a great introduction to the adventures to follow.</p>

      <h2> HURRY UP !! READ THIS </h2>
      <p>Lily, the caretaker’s daughter, was literally run off her feet. Hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest. It was well for her she had not to attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies’ dressing-room. Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask her who had come. It was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan’s annual dance.  </p>

      <h2> CHECK IT HURRY UP </h2>
      <p>Hello Monday is a design agency based in Denmark. It aims to create immersive digital experiences that tell a story and bring joy to their users, and it has gone one step beyond with its portfolio site. When creating a studio site, the difficulty is that adopting cool or cutting-edge design ideas often means sacrificing clarity and usability, which is paramount for a design portfolio.  </p>
